## Introduction ##

This repository contains the first Open Gravitational-wave Catalog (1-OGW), which is obtained by using the public data from Advanced LIGO's first observing run to search for compact-object binary mergers. Our analysis is based on new methods that improve the separation between signals and noise in matched-filter searches for gravitational waves from the merger of compact objects. 

We make available our complete catalog of events, including the sub-threshold population of candidates. The catalog contains approximately 150,000 candidate events. We note that since the vast majority of the events in the catalog are likely to be noise, we have provided information to rank and select candidate events. The three most significant signals in our catalog correspond to the binary black hole mergers  [GW150914](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102), [GW151226](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.241103), and [LVT151012](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.93.122003), respectively. We observe these signals at a true discovery rate of 99.92%. We find that LVT151012 alone has a 97.6% probability of being astrophysical in origin. No other significant binary black hole candidates are found, nor did we observe any significant binary neutron star or neutron star--black hole candidates.

The catalog is stored in the file '1-OGC.hdf'. There are a variety of tools to access [hdf files](https://www.hdfgroup.org/) from numerous computing languages. Here we will focus on access through python and [h5py](www.h5py.org).

## Analysis Details ##
Details of the analysis are available in this [preprint paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01921) and the configuration files needed to create the analysis workflows are provided in the [workflow/configuration](https://github.com/gwastro/1-ogc/tree/master/workflow/configuration) directory.

## Accessing the Catalog: 1-OGC.hdf ##

There are two datasets within the file, `/complete` and `/bbh`. The `complete` set is the full dataset from our analysis. The `bbh` set includes BBH candidates from a select portion of the analysis. See the 1-OGC paper for additional information. 


```python
import h5py

catalog = h5py.File('./1-OGC.hdf', 'r')

# Get a numpy structured array of the candidate event properties.
all_candidates = catalog['complete']
bbh_candidates = catalog['bbh']

# Accessing a column by name
ranking_values = all_candidates['stat']

# Selecting parts of the catalog
region = all_candidates['mass1'] + all_candidates['mass2'] < 4
lowmass_candidates = all_candidates[region]

```


##### File format #####
Both datasets are structured arrays which have the following named columns. Some of these columns give information specific to either the 
LIGO Hanford or Livingston detectors. Where this is the case, the name of the column is prefixed with either a `H1` or `L1`.
